# RentFun Application for Arbitrum Grant Program
**Proposer:** Blank, the co-founder and CEO of RentFun

**Grant type:** Arbitrum-native NFT Rental Protocol

**Payment Address:** 0x4d3a8F683F2D27Cc38E638BF5398d4a9Bd548B85

**Grant Amount:** $30K

**Why Request This Grant?**

* RentFun is revolutionizing the Access Delegation Protocol by building it upon the ERC-6551 Vault Account, with the ultimate goal of unlocking liquidity for NFT utility on both Arbitrum One and Nova.


* Since its inception in early January 2023, the entire project has been self-funded by the founder, Blank. Despite the ongoing bearish market conditions, RentFun has not yet sought external funding.


* However, the development of the testnet, security audits, and marketing campaigns entail significant costs. Therefore, securing a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation would be immensely beneficial for RentFun to cover these essential expenses.

## Project Overview

RentFun's primary objective is to establish an NFT rental hub, promoting the liquidity of NFT utility on both Arbitrum One and Nova.

At the core of RentFun's vision lies a groundbreaking Access Delegation Protocol, designed to streamline the process for NFT owners, allowing them to delegate access rights solely to the renters to realize the NFT rentals.

Key Features of RentFun include:

* Complete safety for NFT owners, ensuring they retain full control over their NFTs.
* Low rental costs for renters, with access to the original NFTs rather than wrapped versions.
* No security risks for the original NFT issuers during integration.
* Capability to lend out an entire account holding hundreds of NFTs.

By incorporating these essential features, RentFun aims to revolutionize the NFT rental space, benefiting both NFT owners and renters alike.


## Problems and Solutions


**Problem #1: 98% NFTs are desperate for solutions to liquify their utility on Arbtrum.**

* Only 1%~2% NFTs are listed on Trove Marketplace or OpenSea Arbitrum which means 98% to 99% NFTs are just staying idly in their owner’s wallets. 
* NFT owners couldn't play the Trove games with their NFTs  24/7. 


**RentFun Solution:** RentFun aims to make the NFT utility freely liquid between NFT owners and renters through the innovative Access Delegation protocol.


**Problem #2: Current NFT rental solutions are not user friendly.**

* Currently there are two models of NFT renting solutions in the market: Over-collateralized Rental and Wrapped NFT Model. 

* The Over-Collateralized  model requires the renter to deposit over 100% collaterals to rent. It is not financially sensible for the renters since the renter just wants to use the NFTs by paying a very small fraction of the cost.

* Wrapped NFT Model locks the original NFTs of owners and issues a totally new wrapped NFT to the renters. This model will cause security risks for the original NFT issuers because they have to accept these new wrapped NFTs to access their ecosystem.

**RentFun Solution:** RentFun proposes a brand new Access Delegation Protocol to ensure that the NFT owners only need to delegate the access rights of the NFTs to the renters. So that the renters could rent the original NFTs without collaterals. And the NFT issuers no need to recognize a brand-new collection to access their ecosystems.


**Problem #3: Utility NFT is the future and Arbitrum NFT projects including games need a native NFT rental protocol to help them expand their user base by lowering down the entry barrier.**

**RentFun Solution:** RentFun builds a native NFT rental hub for Arbitrum One and Nova to serve any NFT projects including games, metaverse, membership cards and RWA NFTs. RentFun will greatly boost their adoption by lowering down the entry barrier in a secure and scalable way.

## Ecosystem Fits
Now, the DeFi space on Arbitrum has reached a high level of maturity, while the NFT space still holds immense untapped potential. Particularly, the Web3 games and Real-world Assets NFTs play a crucial role in driving mass adoption on Arbitrum. In line with this, Arbitrum has allocated significant resources to attract game developers, as evidenced by the launch of the Nova chain.

As the native NFT rental protocol on Arbitrum, RentFun aims to contribute significantly to the expansion of user bases for all NFT projects on the platform. This will be achieved through the following benefits:
* I**ncreased Accessibility:** RentFun allows more users to access NFT projects' ecosystems by offering NFT rentals at a fraction of the ownership cost.
* **Enhanced Attractiveness of NFTs:** NFT holders will find their assets more appealing, knowing they can earn passive income by renting them out.
* **Bridging the Gap:** RentFun bridges the gap between individuals with limited time and financial resources within NFT communities.

By providing these advantages, RentFun plays a crucial role in propelling the growth and adoption of NFTs on Arbitrum, making it an invaluable asset for the platform's overall success.

## Challenges

**Challenge 1: Lack of Funds**

Currently, the project relies solely on personal funding from Blank, the founder of RentFun, for the past 6 months with a runway of $10K USD monthly. However, raising funds in the current bearish market presents a significant challenge. Without sufficient financial support, the project's development may be at risk.

**Solution:** To address this issue, RentFun aims to secure a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. This grant will provide the necessary resources to support the team in releasing a fully functional product within the next 4 months. Additionally, during this time, the team will actively pursue a pre-seed round to secure further funding.

**Challenge 2: Integrations**

RentFun's success is dependent on NFT projects integrating the RentFun SDK into their front-end codes, enabling renters to access games or portals seamlessly. This process demands robust business development capabilities.

**Solution:** The team is committed to continuously building and showcasing the value of RentFun to boost user activity and engagement for the trove games. By presenting well-designed proof-of-concept demos, RentFun has already established official partnerships with LifeVerse, PrimapesDAO, Legend of EROS, and Gainlings. As the mainnet launch approaches, these partners will witness the real value of RentFun, making integrations smoother and more feasible.
